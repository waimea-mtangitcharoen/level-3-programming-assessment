![Ending window](images/finishingPopUp.png)

A pop-up window has been added to the game. Once the timer hits 0 (i.e. time stops running), a window pop-up to show that the game has ended.
For this pop up, I need to:
- Position the "congratulations" text
- Have a label showing the player's finishing score
- Play again button
- Once exit, the game reset.

I have just instantiated the play again button on the finishing window. There is a problem for it to function.

- I think it will appear better and make more sense if the first alphabetical letter is in uppercase.

![Fix UI](images/guiReAdjust.png)

This is what I think should be fixed or re-adjusted for the UI.

![Fixed left and right margin](images/leftRightMargin.png)

Left-right margin is now fixed. However, the top and bottom margin are still not equal.

![Adjust the heading](images/headingAdjust.png)

Heading has now been readjusted. It is put at the centre of the window with an increase in font-size.

![Some components moved](images/componentAdjust.png)

It has been re-adjusted a little bit more. It still looks packed and not in place because I have just only moved the how to play button and play button.

![Locations moved](images/locationsAdjust.png])

Looking better once the current location and description labels have been moved.

![Final GUI](images/guiFinalAdjust.png)

The interface if the game now looks reasonably better. Maybe I should add boxes around some components.
