A pop-up window has been added to the game. Once the timer hits 0 (i.e. time stops running), a window pop-up to show that the game has ended.
For this pop up, I need to:
- Position the "congratulations" text
- Have a label showing the player's finishing score
- Play again button
- Once exit, the game reset.

I have just instantiated the play again button on the finishing window. There is a problem for it to function.

- I think it will appear better and make more sense if the first alphabetical letter is in uppercase.
